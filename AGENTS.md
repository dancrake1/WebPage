# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The site is anchored by `experimental-book-journal.html`, with earlier experiments and reference assets preserved in `Archive/`. Core styling lives in `css/styles.css`, which defines global custom properties, font imports, and component rules used across the page. Interactive behaviors are modularized in `js/`: `main.js` wires up lifecycle hooks, `blob-effects.js` handles hero and spine visuals, and `grid-background.js` manages the generative grid toggle. Media assets (optimized JPG/PNG) reside in `images/`, while font files are stored in `fonts/`. Keep new assets grouped in these directories so paths remain consistent with existing imports.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `python3 -m http.server 8000` (run from the repo root) serves the site locally without additional tooling.
- `open http://localhost:8000/experimental-book-journal.html` launches the current build in the default browser for manual review. When working on historical variants, point the URL to the matching file under `Archive/`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use two-space indentation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Favor semantic HTML sections and descriptive IDs that match the visual element (e.g., `grid-toggle-container`). In CSS, extend the existing custom property palette declared in `:root` before introducing hard-coded colors, and keep selector chains shallow. JavaScript modules follow an `initFeature` pattern; expose a single initializer per module, guard against missing DOM nodes, and avoid introducing global variables outside the existing namespace.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no automated test harness, so rely on quick manual passes: confirm layout stability in Chrome and Safari, toggle the grid controls, and verify blob animations on resize. Use browser devtoolsâ€™ responsive mode to check breakpoints and watch the console for errors. Document any known limitations in your PR description so the next contributor can reproduce them.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Git history favors concise, present-tense summaries (e.g., `tweaks to adding new section and formatting`). Keep commits scoped to one concern, and update screenshots in `Archive/` when visual changes are significant. For pull requests, include a short overview, before/after captures for UI changes, and reference the related issue or design note. Call out manual test steps you completed so reviewers can focus on unverified paths.
